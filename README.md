**CTNorth** is an open source game engine recreation and modification framework for the PC versions of old Grand Theft Auto games, bundling with networked multiplayer, in which this functionality is not orginally found.

Primarily focused around the PC version of GTA: San Andreas; CTNorth is designed to give access to the most of what the game's engine can offer.

The project is currently in an early stage of development.
I'm working on CTNorth solo in my spare time, so please keep in mind: the project activity will vary greatly from time to time.
